        <h3>Relief</h3>
        <hr>
        <p>
           " My experience with Reiki has been a positive and informative one thanks to Karen Peters. As a traditional medicine aficionado, I was skeptical as to how Reiki could improve my health. I was a convert once Karen performed Reiki for me. I had chronic knee pain and digestive issues that made travel difficult. On a trip to New York City I called Karen for a Reiki session. Within a short period of time my knee pain subsided and I experienced no digestive issues for the duration of the day. It was the easiest trip I have ever had. Since then Karen has performed Reiki for me several times and I am a believer! If I could get it every day I would! I also like that Karen explains Reiki and how works. Thank you Karen for helping to keep my in good health!"

            centered, and her hands-on approach is incredibly effective. She is thorough and caring while

        <h3>Absentee</h3>
        <hr>
        <p>
     "Karen recently sent absentee healing to my daughter with the flu in Europe. My daughter made quicker improvements, and Karen even picked up on pain in her shoulder blade; I had not been aware of this but my daughter confirmed this when asked. My daughter's healing was more effective with Karen's absentee Reiki than with a local practitioner who was in the same room! Karen has done absentee Reiki a few times for us in the past years, and there is no doubt in my mind that she is a highly perceptive and truly gifted absentee Reiki practitioner."

        <h3>Relaxing</h3>
        <hr>
        <p>
            “After receiving Reiki from Karen at a party where I wasn’t feeling well, I have to admit I was a bit disappointed since she lived several hundred miles away, and then she shared she could conduct a session remotely. I was a bit skeptical on how it would work, but after the first session I was convinced! Each time I come away feeling completely relaxed and healed. Karen is always always able to speak with me following as session and to share her observations. Regardless if I’m in my own home or traveling. Karen’s remote sessions have always provided me the healing that is needed.. I can also attest ow she’s helped my dogs!”
