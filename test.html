              >My experience with Reiki has been a positive and informative one
              thanks to Karen Peters. As a traditional medicine aficionado, I
              was skeptical as to how Reiki, given from hundreds of miles away,
              could improve my health. I was a convert once Karen performed
              Reiki for me. I had chronic knee pain and digestive issues that
              made travel difficult. On a trip to New York City I called Karen
              for a Reiki session. Within a short period of time my knee pain
              subsided and I experienced no digestive issues for the duration of
              the day. It was the easiest trip I have ever had. Since then Karen
              has performed Reiki for me several times and I am a believer! If I
              could get it every day I would! I also like that Karen explains
              Reiki and how it works. Thank you Karen for helping to keep me in
              good health!</q

              absentee Reiki a few times for us in the past years, and there is

              lived several hundred miles away, and then she shared she could
              conduct a session remotely. I was a bit skeptical on how it would
              work, but after the first session I was convinced! Each time I
              come away feeling completely relaxed and healed. Karen is always
              always able to speak with me following a session and to share her
              observations. Regardless if I’m in my own home or traveling.
              Karen’s remote sessions have always provided me the healing that
              is needed.. I can also attest how she’s helped my dogs!</q

              before he was born as she did many sessions for me while I was
              expecting!). He was having some anxiety at preschool. He is very
              sensitive and a situation at school was stressing him out which
              just breaks this Mama Bear's heart. Karen did a remote treatment
              for him to help the issue. The very NEXT MORNING dropping him off
              at school was already improved! He didn't cry or fuss or try to
              hide behind my husband's legs like he had been doing for the past
              week. Karen even checked in with me over the next few days & told
              me what to use for reinforcement of the message with him. She is
              just remarkable and I'm so blessed to have her in my life and the

              I live in the U.K. and have known Karen for many years. Karen has
              provided remote Reiki to my family through a variety of medical
              issues such as back problems, Lyme disease and an acute knee
              injury. She is remarkably perceptive and will pick up exactly
              where the problem is without us telling her. She recently picked
              up that my throat needed energy and sent that in a post Reiki
              feedback email; when I thought about it, I had forgotten to take
              my thyroid pill that day. This has happened a number of times,
              when she has picked up something that makes total sense to me. She
              is a true Reiki healer and we could not do without her! After the
              doctor, Karen is our first email to ask for help.</q
