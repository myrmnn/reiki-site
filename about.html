        I took my first Reiki course in 1991 and was hooked! l was living in
        Massachusetts at the time. Two years later I moved to New
        Hampshire and learned that one of the original 22 Reiki Masters
        trained in the United States lived in Rindge, N.H. You can imagine
        my excitement! (Reiki was brought to The U.S. by a woman
        named Hawayo Takata in 1938. She trained 22 Reiki Masters
        before her passing in 1980.) The opportunity to study with someone so close to "the source" of Reiki was one I couldn't pass
        up. 
        I enrolled in The John Harvey Gray Center for Reiki Healing
        and retook Levels I and ll. I completed Level ll advanced and my
        Mastership with John's wife and lineage bearer, <a href="https://www.learnreiki.org/reiki-master-teacher/lourdes-gray/" target="_blank">Lourdes Gray</a>.
        Little did I know what was in store for me when I took that first
        Reiki class. A whole new world unveiled itself to me. A world
        where l felt empowered yet humbled. When l first saw, or rather
        felt, Reiki energy I was stunned. Stunned that not everyone knew
        about this. It is Simple to learn, safe, effective...why didn't I know
        about this sooner? </p>

            Having Reiki skills is like having a tool kit with
            you at all times. Because Reiki can work on all levels (physical,
            mental, and emotional) there's always something you can do to
            help in any situation. lt has given me the confidence to know that
            where ever my family or clients are in the world, if they're having
            a problem, or need a confidence boost, or an obstacle cleared,
            I can help them. l've sent Reiki to job interviews, auditions, exams,
            
            weddings, dentist offices, hospitals, operating rooms,
            veterinarians, school field trips, airplanes, pets, funerals,
            relationships, the list goes on and on! l've even pulled over at
            accident scenes to share Reiki. The applications are endless.
            I truly use Reiki every day. lt brings me peace and hope. lt has
            opened my mind to believe in and see miracles. I now know for
            sure all things are possible. I also know how much more there is
            to learn. As Aristotle said,</p> <blockquote>"The more you know, the more you
            know you don't know." </blockquote> 
            <p>So after eighteen years of discovery
            through Reiki I feel like I've only seen the tip of the iceberg. l'm
            thrilled and excited to see what comes next. Want to join me?
