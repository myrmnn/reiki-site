        <p>
            <span class="lead-word">Reiki</span> is a healing art of Japanese origin. lts name comes from the
    Japanese words "rei" which means universal life and "ki" which
    means energy.
    lt is the energy that flows all around us and through every living
    thing. lt
    enables plants to grow, broken
    bones to mend, and emotions to stabilize. lt is inherent in us all
    and we all use Reiki every day. When you hold the hand of a
    frightened child, give a hug or put your hand over a toothache,
    that is Reiki. Specially trained Reiki practitioners are attuned to
    increase this flow of energy and to transfer it to their clients to
    restore, unblock, and revitalize energy flow. lt enhances the
    body's natural healing response. Treatments are safe, gentle, and
    effective and are suitable for everyone, including children and
    seniors.

        Why Reiki? <br> What can it do for me?
        <hr>
    </h2>

    <p>
    It is believed that Reiki can accelerate healing on the physical,
    mental and emotional levels therefore it can help just about any
    condition. As such it is used in many hospitals, nursing homes,
    and wellness centers. Reiki is often used to relieve anxiety, stress,
    pain, insomnia, grief , sports injuries, and to facilitate healing and
    minimize blood loss during surgery. Many use Reiki to lessen the side effects of chemotherapy and alcohol/drug withdrawal. You
    don't need to be sick to benefit from Reiki.
    lt can be used
    prophylactically to keep you balanced and promote wellbeing.

        What can I expect at a Reiki session?
        <hr>
    </h2>
    <p>

    Reiki promotes a deep sense of relaxation. lt is within this relaxed
    state that the body is best able to heal. lt ii also a wonderful time
    for the mind to unwind. We will begin with a brief interview and a
    client intake form. This helps me make the best use of our time.
    Rest assured your confidentiality is maintained at all times. A
    Reiki session takes place on a massage table while you are fully
    clothed. An established pattern of hand placements on the body
    are followed. You witll be informed of this pattern prior to the session. lf you are uncomfortable lying down or with the hand
    placements on the body accommodations are easily made
    without effecting treatment results. The priority is to make you
    comfortable. This is where the restoration can begin.

    <h2>
        Distance/Absentee Reiki
        <hr>
    </h2>
    <p>

    A Reiki session can be provided at a distance. That means that I
    can be in one place and the receiver can be in another. Distance
    or Absentee Reiki is just as effective as an in person treatment.
    The person receiving the energy can be working, sleeping, or
    relaxing, it does not matter. However, I prefer that the client
    takes time to relax because often they can feel the energy
    transfer as if they were having a hands on treatment! This is a
    great way to support a friend or family member who is in the
    hospital or otherwise immobile. Permission from the individual
    receiving Reiki is required unless it is an emergency.
    
    I have clients
    in many states across the U.S. I even have
    international clients. I have been doing these treatments for many
    years and to this day it still leaves me a bit awestruck.
